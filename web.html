    <p>In this Assignment, we will be covering some of the foundational concepts of web development, starting with HTML. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. 
        We'll begin by learning about basic HTML tags, which are used to structure and format content on a webpage.</p>
        <p>Welcome to our assignment.  

            In addition to tags, we'll also explore how to create links, which allow users to navigate between different pages or websites. Tables are another important element of web design, and we'll show you how to create them to organize data and improve readability.</p><br>
